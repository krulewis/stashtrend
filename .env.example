# Copy this file to .env and fill in your Monarch Money token.
#
# How to find your token:
#   1. Log in to app.monarchmoney.com in Chrome
#   2. Open DevTools (Cmd+Option+I on Mac, F12 on Windows/Linux)
#   3. Click the "Network" tab, then reload the page
#   4. Click any request to api.monarchmoney.com
#   5. Under "Headers", find: Authorization: Token xxxxxx...
#   6. Copy everything AFTER "Token " (the long string, not the word "Token")
#
# Alternatively, leave this blank and use the setup wizard at http://localhost
# when you first start the app — it will walk you through the same steps.
